### NOTES ######################################################################
1.) The wifi_tx.py and driver.sh files must be executed on an instance of the
grc3.7 DragonRadio container.

2.) Some files below are duplicated in the included subdirectories because they
were used to compute values and other necessary information for files only
included therein.

3.) The most effective and efficient way to reproduce our results is to run
driver.sh, closing each of the windows after 10 seconds of transmission time.

4.) If you open wifi_tx.grc and choose to generate a python script from 
gnuradio-companion, it will overwrite wifi_tx.py. If you then want to use this
newly generated script with driver.sh, you will have to re-parameterize
wifi_tx.py. This could be tedious and highly annoying, and so I don't recommend
you do this. Instead, if you'd like to run the system using gnuradio-companion,
first rename wifi_tx.py, then generate the new python script.

5.) Running the plotting scripts might be annoying and confusing. Just a
warning.

### FILES ######################################################################
- driver.sh
    - The driver script we wrote to run the experiment with different
      signal-to-jammer ratios
    - Can be used with either wifi_tx.py or wifi_tx_awgn.py
    - Note that each trial was terminated manually after 10 seconds, for ease
      of implementation
- wifi_tx.py
    - The transmitter, receiver, and jammer system with no AWGN
    - Note this file only includes the single-subcarrier jammer
- wifi_tx_awgn.py
    - The transmitter, receiver, and jammer system with AWGN
    - Note this file only includes the interleaving jammer
- calc_sjr.py
    - Used to calculate the received signal-to-jammer ratio
    - Written using python 3.5.2
- plot_per.py
    - Used to plot the packet error rate (PER) for each SJR value
    - Written using python 3.5.2
- parse_msg.py
    - Used to parse the message debug output file generated by driver.sh
    - Saves a dictionary to a file to indicate how many packets we actually
      transmitted while the system was running
- parse_pcap.py
    - Used to parse the .pcap files in a directory, determine the number of
      packets within, and save a dictionary that associates trial number and
      number of packets
    - Written using python 3.5.2
- plot_per_no_noise.py
    - Used to plot only the packet error rate of the single-subcarrier jammer
      in the absence of AWGN
- wifi_tx.grc
    - The gnuradio-companion flow diagram associated with wifi_tx_awgn.py
